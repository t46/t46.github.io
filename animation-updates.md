## Key Features Added

### 1. Smooth Page Transitions
- Elegant fade transitions between pages
- Prevents jarring page loads and creates a seamless browsing experience
- Pages smoothly fade out when leaving and fade in when arriving

### 2. Element Animations
- Content elements animate into view as you scroll down the page
- Headings, paragraphs, and list items have distinct, subtle entrance animations
- Section titles feature an elegant underline animation

### 3. Interactive UI Elements
- Menu toggles with fluid animations
- Navigation links with subtle hover effects
- Social icons with scale and color transitions on hover
- Logo with subtle scale effects on interaction

### 4. Scroll-Aware Header
- Header hides when scrolling down (saving screen space)
- Reappears instantly when scrolling up (improving navigation)
- Subtle background blur effect for depth

### 5. Parallax Effects

### 6. Custom Cursor (Desktop Only)

- Enhances the premium feel of the site
- Automatically disabled on mobile for better usability

### 7. Performance Optimizations
- Animations use hardware acceleration for smooth rendering
- Passive event listeners improve scroll performance
- Animations are progressively enhanced, so the site works even if JavaScript is disabled

## How to Customize

### Adjusting Animation Speed
In `styles.css`, you can modify animation durations by changing the timing values in the transition and animation properties. For example:
```css
.fade-in {
    animation: fadeIn 1s forwards; /* Change 1s to adjust speed */
}
```

### Changing Animation Effects
You can modify individual animation effects by editing the keyframe definitions in `styles.css`. For example:
```css
@keyframes fadeIn {
    0% {
        opacity: 0;
        transform: translateY(20px); /* Adjust this value */
    }
    100% {
        opacity: 1;
        transform: translateY(0);
    }
}
```

### Disabling Features
If you want to disable certain features:

- **Custom Cursor**: Remove or comment out the cursor-related code in `script.js` and `styles.css`
- **Page Transitions**: Remove the `initPageTransitions()` call in `script.js`
- **Header Scroll Behavior**: Remove the `initHeaderScroll()` call in `script.js`

## Technical Details

The implementation uses:
- Pure CSS animations and transitions (no external libraries)
- Intersection Observer API for scroll-triggered animations
- Custom JavaScript for interactive elements
- CSS variables for easy theming

All animations maintain accessibility standards and degrade gracefully on older browsers.

## Browser Compatibility
All features are compatible with:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Mobile browsers (with appropriate fallbacks)

## Next Steps

To apply these changes to other pages, simply:
1. Add `animate-on-scroll` class to elements you want to animate
2. Add `parallax` class to images that should have the parallax effect
3. Ensure the header and menu structure matches across all pages

Enjoy your modernized website experience!
