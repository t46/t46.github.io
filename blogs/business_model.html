				<p id="5bc0ce6b-3619-4c7e-b285-499ea5dfba99" class="">The business model of academic publishing is quite
					simple. The publisher simply publishes articles submitted by researchers in journals and makes money
					from the subscription fees. This alone is not much different from the ordinal journal publishing
					business, so there seems no need to illustrate it.</p>
				<p id="b693d4e5-25cb-46f9-8a68-508581979147" class="">However, academic publishing has several
					characteristics unique to the research industry. In preparation for explaining them, we will first
					explain how articles are published and delivered to researchers.</p>
				<h3 id="08b7792d-3852-4439-8f50-cf0cf7543523" class="">Paper publication steps</h3>
				<p id="5f9ced24-865c-4fea-8cdf-530f410bd5c6" class="">First, when a researcher writes a research paper, they
					submit it to a publisher. Editors first read the submitted paper, judging whether it is in line with the
					theme and objectives of the journal.</p>
				<p id="14a2f408-c4e1-4dbf-b521-b8a10df93d1f" class="">If the paper passes this review, it will go to the
					peer review stage. Peer review is a process in which researchers who are experts in the same field of
					research papers review the paper. Research papers are documents with extremely highly specialized
					content. Therefore, a non-specialist can’t judge whether the claims made in the paper are valid and
					whether the content is academically valuable. This is why other researchers must determine whether or
					not the paper can be published in the journal.</p>
				<p id="98f8f7dd-62fa-440a-8e54-a9392fc17007" class="">Reviewers make a decision as a result of the peer
					review process: “Accept,” “Revision,” or “Reject. If “Revision,” the author(s) of the paper will address
					the items that require revision. This can range in degree from a slight change in wording to additional
					experimentation. It can take several months or even years. Once accepted, the paper is edited by the
					publisher and is finally published.</p>

				</figure>
				<p id="dbad946c-02ef-4776-a7f7-51d82ab61dbd" class="">In most cases, researchers do not subscribe to
					academic journals directly. Instead, the institution to which researchers belong subscribes to them. In
					particular, in the case of researchers in a university, the university library subscribes to journals.
					The library adds subscribed journals to the university’s journal database, and researchers read the
					submitted articles through the database.</p>
				<h3 id="e82af3c5-b7d2-40a3-8d1f-f2e17c398bb0" class="">Peculiarities of academic publishing</h3>
				<p id="a11ab9ce-9de6-481e-be38-8f20ce391cc1" class="">We have described the general flow of academic
					publishing. At first glance, this is an ordinary publishing business. However, there are a number of
					distortions in this business structure.</p>
				<p id="8d1af69e-8bd4-44e4-86d6-4f56f9d14294" class="">The first is that publishers do not pay for reviewers.
					Peer review is an important part of the work that determines whether an article is accepted for
					publication. However, it is generally done on a volunteer basis. As mentioned above, reviewers not only
					examine papers but also provide feedback on them. These are all for free. Furthermore, reviewers’ names
					are not made public. Therefore, others do not know how much the reviewers have contributed to the review
					of a paper. Current reviewers review purely for internal rewards.</p>
				<figure id="8f46e066-89c2-4063-8600-16f21732fcec" class="image"><a

						</figure>
				<p id="32bb1bc7-be88-4a74-a833-0d57931ac062" class="">Second, publishers do not pay researchers. Publishers
					make money by selling the journals in which the papers are published. However, the authors of the
					research papers are not paid. On the contrary, the author pays the article proceeding fee when their
					manuscript is accepted for publication.</p>
				<p id="6b598c8a-61db-4e3a-b672-c49d88ec73b1" class="">In recent years, open access has become popular, which
					allows authors to read articles without subscribing to a journal. In this case, authors may also pay an
					article submission fee when submitting their paper. This is to compensate the publishers for the profit
					they would have earned from the sale of the journal.</p>
				<p id="0b211f83-8c9d-4b4a-bf63-bd01b5487832" class="">Third, authors transfer their copyright to the
					publisher. In the case of open access, copyright often belongs to the author. Traditionally, however,
					copyright belongs to the publisher of the journal. Therefore, it is a violation of copyright to display
					one’s own paper on a website without permission (this is often allowed as an exceptional case, though).
				</p>

						</figure>
				<p id="601e64af-fc94-428e-994c-8aeb6a6dfe67" class="">One major problem with this is that much of the
					research is supported by public funds, i.e., taxes. In other words, taxpayer-funded research has become
					the work of a private company, and unless you pay for it, you cannot even read it. This situation is
					sometimes referred to as an article held back by a paywall.</p>
				<h3 id="489fdab8-bf4e-45d3-88c0-debcbb8a471c" class="">Profit structure of academic publishing</h3>
				<p id="e7915db4-72b7-4e9b-ae99-86c30160a378" class="">As you may have noticed from the business model
					illustration and the explanation, very little money is leaving the publisher. Of course, operations,
					including editing, etc., are hard work, but more money flows into the publisher.</p>
				<p id="d5f42eb1-44c7-4cf5-a02a-ead24d4c6457" class="">In fact, major publishers have consistently made
					profit margins of 30~40% in recent years. Below is a chart of profit margins for the well-known RELX
					Group (formerly Reed Elsevier) through 2015. It can be seen that profit margins have grown rapidly,
					especially in the science and technology sector (including academic publishing) since the 2000s (Figure
					B).</p>

					explanation. The first is a book by <a
						href="https://scholar.google.co.jp/citations?user=UFWuu4MAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao">Dr. Masaki

				<h3 id="76327506-7d35-42da-81e5-89b301ddb624" class="">When did the commercialization of academic journal
					publishing begin?</h3>
				<p id="b1d063f7-283a-40f1-87bb-e7d1d0fd5c23" class="">So-called scholarly publishing is said to have begun
					in the 17th century. However, from the 17th to the 19th century, many academic journals were not as
					profitable as they are today, and many publishers struggled to stay afloat.</p>
				<p id="2477ea04-e368-45b8-94e7-51b024b21264" class="">A businessman Robert Maxwell and the publishing
					company he founded in 1951, Pergamon, changed academic publishing into the business model we know today.
					Since his arrival, academic journal publishing has become rapidly commercialized.</p>

				<h3 id="3df3b3ba-99cc-43c0-b2ec-b04740041632" class="">Why did the commercialization of academic journal
					publishing begin?</h3>
				<h3 id="466881bb-cda7-4885-8414-06250bac596b" class="">Maxwell’s business style</h3>
				<p id="61a6b879-901b-4c12-9cc0-c2bd268349a1" class="">I believe that the reason for the commercialization of
					academic publishing can be summed up in one word: Maxwell did business well.</p>
				<p id="05de1546-4bf7-4db1-8a9e-3d2235dcef7a" class="">The publishing style of Maxwell was quite simple:
					publish new journals one after another. But it was perfectly suited to the needs of researchers.</p>
				<p id="719d9538-99b2-4974-89cd-f28b3314b7f4" class="">Journals are a place for researchers to present their
					work. Therefore, researchers were grateful that more diverse journals appeared and accepted more papers
					quickly.</p>
				<p id="90c4aafe-3d82-4591-93f3-7cf3e71e9a7b" class="">For example, computer science, molecular biology, and
					brain science were unorthodox fields at that time. This made it difficult to publish these works in
					traditional journals. Maxwell approached researchers in these fusion fields and appointed them editors
					to publish papers in new fusion fields. In addition, the publication cycle of academic conferences was
					too slow for researchers. Researchers wanted to report their results before the competitor and to make
					their achievements quickly to get a job. Maxwell responded to this need by creating journals with a fast
					publication cycle.</p>

				<p id="3b948c4d-3fdd-4bce-86a8-2cc203643760" class="">Maxwell entertained and incorporated researchers in
					various ways to publish new journals. He attended many conferences and held parties, invited researchers
					to his villa, took them out on his yacht, gave them checks, and gave them airplanes (!?). Such
					hospitality was a powerful magnet for researchers who had been far away from the glamorous world. In
					particular, the hospitality extended to mid-career researchers. Combined with the publication of the new
					journals, Maxwell must have been a truly wonderful person for the researchers of the time.</p>
				<p id="5b559472-8f49-4816-8bb7-fd7149fccb50" class="">As a result of publishing more and more journals in
					this way, Pergamon went from publishing 40 journals in 1959 to as many as 150 in just six years. As a
					result of this expansion, university libraries had to purchase an enormous number of journals. This put
					pressure on the cost of the university library, which I mentioned above.</p>
				<h3 id="30a91946-7784-42da-925c-037013485cb7" class="">Factors behind Pergamon’s breakthrough</h3>
				<p id="40f2715a-68d8-4a5a-8532-55b1fdc9527c" class="">I explained that Pergamon increased its number of
					publications because of Maxwell’s business strength and because the journal served as a place to
					evaluate performance. But that was not the only thing that solidified Pergamon’s position in commercial
					publishing.</p>
				<p id="561c6206-a6f6-4c27-b434-fc9397bfc18b" class="">First and foremost, journals have a “competitors do
					not compete with each other for profits” nature. An article is a report on what has been revealed for
					the first time in the world. By their very nature, no two studies are the same. Therefore, if the paper
					you want to read is only available in a journal, you will be forced to buy that journal.</p>
				<p id="2b79ee50-69fd-4233-baea-f6f3de3a2d60" class="">Because of this nature, as new papers and new journals
					appear, university libraries must purchase them continuously as long as researchers need them. This is
					why the more journals you produce, the more money you can make.</p>
				<p id="6c0c0684-1fc6-4f60-88eb-856adae20585" class="">Further fueling this trend was the emphasis on basic
					science in the 1960s, when, Western countries invested huge amounts of money in science in response to
					the Sputnik Crisis. This resulted in instituting several policies to subsidize scientific research. This
					allowed academic journal publishers to reduce their burden and increase their revenues.</p>
				<p id="d707e0e9-c51f-4d78-8062-07d3f7302c29" class=""><a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_crisis"><strong>Sputnik crisis -

				<p id="ceb4a404-dd2e-4e16-a068-b314d04ea9bf" class="">And this science-focused policy ultimately led to high
					subscription fees for academic journals. The high profits of this period became the benchmark for
					academic journal publishing. Even after the scientific boom, it compensated by raising subscription fees
					(already in 1988, Pergamon’s profit margin was 47%).</p>
				<p id="25523c46-15bb-4dc5-af83-6f3bf21233d7" class="">Dr. Masaki Arita, author of “The Road of Academic
					Publishing,” accurately points out where the problem lies as follows.</p>
				<blockquote id="1afba963-3e4a-44bc-bc95-ed3c57e82adb" class="">The increase in journal prices is due to the
					demand for publication by researchers. As research funding declines, competition among researchers
					increases and the demand for publication increases. As the number of submissions increases, publishers
					will either increase the number of pages or launch new journals in proportion to the increase. In any
					case, they will not move in the direction of reducing profit margins, which were originally set high.
				</blockquote>
				<p id="6449fd50-bab3-40fc-8563-c35f64bf72cd" class="">Pergamon was acquired by Elsevier in 1991. Three years
					later, Elsevier raised its subscription fees by 50% (!?). Nevertheless, for the reasons discussed above,
					university libraries could not stop subscribing to the journal. The reins have been completely taken
					over by commercial publishing.</p>
				<p id="c3922740-6ace-4ab7-bfdf-8714df3a88b7" class="">Another major factor that supported this profit
					structure was the fact that researchers originally did the work of academic journal publishing on a
					volunteer basis. Since they did also peer review on a volunteer basis, there was no resistance among
					researchers to continuing to do peer review for free.</p>
				<p id="d91ad9c4-6998-4d29-812e-98a502b9c095" class="">Rather, the publishers took over all the editing,
					coordination, bookbinding, and other work that researchers had been doing themselves. Instead, they only
					had to take care of the truly scholarly discussions. It must be a blessing for researchers at the time.
				</p>
				<p id="b5bc49eb-cf22-468e-8c80-436fe7291b4f" class="">The style of publishing that Maxwell established was
					simple. But this was the decisive move to exploit great wealth from the research industry.</p>
				<h3 id="db394a0f-154c-4dd6-89de-6cd953c8bdfa" class="">Why is the problem of academic journal publishing not
					resolved yet?</h3>
				<p id="a1b0bdd1-fc15-4e02-ba74-794279529ec2" class="">I have explained that the academic journal publishing
					business has a distorted structure and that this was a consequence of the commercialization that began
					in the 1950s.</p>
				<p id="deae1dc8-1afc-4091-9b5d-448c5134726b" class="">In fact, in the 1980s, university books already raised
					the issue of high-profit margins in academic journal publishing. Why, then, has this problem not been

					to be the place to publish achievements?” If it is a problem that journals are the place to announce our
					achievements, why don’t we move to a different place to present our achievements? However, the authority

					since the appearance of Cell in 1970. Cell is still the top journal in life science today. It started as
					a journal that published only research reporting epoch-making results. As a result, the peer review
					process became tougher. Then, there appeared a widespread perception in the community that publishing in
					Cell is a great achievement. As a result, not only “what to publish” but also “which journal to publish”
					became very important, and the journal ranking began to have authority.</p>

				<p id="399c5980-2174-4347-8c0d-c58cead9534f" class="">The “Impact Factor” has accelerated this trend. Simply
					put, the Impact Factor measures the average number of times an article published in a journal has been
					recently cited. People used this measure to evaluate how a journal has an impact. Then, journals with a
					high Impact Factor were considered highly ranked journals. As a result, the ranking of journals became
					quantified, and the authority of journal ranking became firmly established.</p>

				<p id="f080ae0c-2f8d-48f8-92f3-81276fffcef4" class="">This authoritarianization made it important for
					researchers to publish their work in highly ranked journals. This ranking was actually used to evaluate
					other researchers and their employment as researchers. This effectively eliminated the idea of
					abandoning journals as a place to publish one’s work. I believe this is one of the reasons that made it
					difficult to solve the problem of academic journal publishing.</p>
				<h3 id="60a39cbe-e0ea-443d-8b04-c09827237adf" class="">Structure of separation of beneficiaries and
					cost bearers</h3>
				<p id="e133ad10-2374-4830-80ab-16f8e61913e6" class="">The second reason is the structure of separation of
					cost bearers and beneficiaries.</p>
				<p id="2ba7a8ca-098f-4e36-a8c9-16d1f83ee319" class="">First, the beneficiaries are the researchers. Since
					there is no reason not to have more journals, researchers have the motivation to buy as many as possible
					if they can do so without hindrance.</p>
				<p id="a1022cf6-8e88-48df-8eeb-9262f86c8a11" class="">Next, the cost-bearers are the research institution
					(in the case of a university, the University Library). Research institution contracts for journal
					subscriptions directly from academic journal publishers. Since researchers know best what they need and
					how much they need, university libraries are willing to respond to requests from researchers as much as
					possible within their budget.</p>
				<p id="44026a19-cb1e-4f30-9379-cae7bd029ad2" class="">Since the cost bearers and beneficiaries are
					separated, researchers are not likely to request a reduction in the number of journals purchased. And
					university libraries try to continue journal subscriptions for researchers as much as possible. I
					believe this is one of the reasons for the currently unsolved problem of academic publishing.</p>
				<p id="06b13e68-d427-4a00-918d-1923462ffa12" class="">The beneficiaries and cost bearers are separated for
					other expenses as well. Researchers rarely pay for research-related expenses out of their own pocket.
					When a researcher pays an article submission or proceeding fee, these costs are funded out of the
					research budget. And not a small percentage of research expenses are public funds, i.e., taxes. I
					believe this reinforces the structure of commercial publishing’s exploitation from the research
					industry. Dr. Arita wrote about this to be very accurate, and I quote it below. Note that this is the
					case in Japan and is not necessarily the case in other countries.</p>
				<blockquote id="8b256e70-ded3-4b4d-914b-447d9f57d2fa" class="">The problem with commercialization is that
					participation fees for conferences and submission fees for journals are covered by public funds
					(taxpayers’ money to begin with). Few researchers pay conference registration fees or journal submission
					fees out of their own salaries. And as far as public funds are concerned, researchers seem to be price
					insensitive: how many researchers would pay more than 100,000 yen (700 dollars) for participation fees
					or 1,250,000 yen (about 9000 dollars) for open access to Nature, even if they had to pay the fees
					themselves? … commercial publishers are well aware of this situation and set their prices accordingly.
				</blockquote>
				<p id="324d99be-150e-4baa-a323-9fe06b81cff3" class="">Tuition and public funds are important for many
					universities’ revenue. Therefore, I think it is the taxpayers and students are more directly affected by
					these exploitative structures.</p>
				<p id="8fe8e031-317a-4571-b7c5-eaf193010f99" class="">However, the vast majority of students graduate from
					university without having made research their profession. And the majority of taxpayers have no way of
					knowing what is going on in the research industry. Thus, the cost payers have little or no voice in the
					matter. I suspect that this separation between cost-bearers and beneficiaries supports the exploitative
					business of commercial publishing.</p>

					maximization of individual utility to optimize the overall objective</h3>
				<p id="7a13e329-aa6d-4beb-b579-3a6d05943701" class="">I have shown how academic journal publishing has
					formed an exploitative structure. I have also explained that the current research ecosystem supports
					this structure. But what I want to discuss here is not who is to blame. What I want to discuss is the
					structure behind the problem.</p>
				<p id="edd99b57-189a-4d5e-b8ed-861ea5e4728d" class="">While I believe it matters to clarify where the
					problem lies, I do not think it is constructive to look for the attribution of blame. Maxwell started
					this business model and Elsevier expanded it because they made the best business choice under the
					conditions of the research industry. Maxwell did provide solutions to the needs of the scientists of the
					time.</p>
				<p id="f5c66b7b-339f-4007-8d8f-5541845882fa" class="">The same holds for researchers. For example. in Japan,
					it was difficult for researchers to carry their awarded budgets to the next year until recently. It was
					even common for the next budget to be reduced (explicitly or not) for over-request if the pledged budget
					was not fully used.</p>
				<p id="e7824b1f-e964-459b-8c5f-114346403808" class="">It is natural, then, to think that the budget must be
					used up in any way possible. It is understandable that the idea of “the more money we can spend, the
					better” would rather arise. The system design discouraged researchers from saving money.</p>
				<p id="f8972a92-657a-415f-90a9-b9d61ea6c8da" class="">You also cannot ignore the reality that the job market
					for researchers remains difficult. Even if the problem is increasing the number of papers, the only way
					to survive as a researcher is to publish papers and aim for top journals. In an environment where one’s
					own survival is threatened, it is harder to be a good person. I believe that pressuring individuals to
					change their behavior will only make the situation worse, but will not solve it.</p>
				<p id="e20db626-1f3b-4484-a78d-b6da67502422" class="">It is natural for humans to optimize their benefit in
					a given environment, and I think that should be. What needs to be changed are the rules, the game, and
					the structure behind it. What we should think about is not “who is at fault,” but “what is the problem”
					and “what kind of game should be designed to solve it”.</p>
				<p id="2642546f-56e4-421c-b101-40888e9e51b2" class="">I believe that a system that imposes burdens on people
					will eventually break down and fail. Above all, I have a sense of value that the people in the system
					will not be happy. I believe it matters to consider how to design a system in which each individual
					maximizes their own utility, but is optimal for human knowledge development.</p>
				<h3 id="18b97576-d28c-4474-bcbc-4bc7e924a9d7" class="">Importance of history in considering systems that
					solve problems</h3>
				<p id="31d401ca-754a-453f-9a42-34e39ee1b680" class="">In considering a system to solve the challenges of
					academic publishing, I believe it matters to start by determining the target state of what research
					should be like. Then, the current system should be considered relative to the multiple possible systems.
					We should consider ways to bridge the gap between the current system and the target state.</p>
				<p id="b7a03b8a-ec3d-4563-8ed4-5723eba77ee6" class="">Knowing history helps us to relativize the present.
					For example, in the research industry, we often hear the phrase “publish or perish” (publish your paper
					or stop being a researcher). However, as mentioned above, publication in academic journals has not been
					as essential as it is now since the 1960s. It was not until the 1970s that everyone started aiming for
					the top journals and the impact factor became important. I didn’t explain it this time, but <a

				<p id="ba72359e-a7d0-4099-949e-7b9f5cc131ff" class="">We assume all of these practices are essential to
					research. However, they all began only five or six decades ago. Consider that Einstein published his
					theory of relativity in 1915, Newton published his laws of motion in 1687, and Euclidean geometry was
					born around 300 B.C. Then, you can see how recent 5 or 60 years ago is in the history of research.</p>
				<p id="8ad1d4e6-6520-443f-a797-c2e624bcfda0" class="">Also, while the current system may have been optimal
					at the time it was created, everything is different now than it was in the past. The Internet is
					commonplace now. Governments do not invest in science and technology as much as they used to win the
					immediate war. And the number of researchers and publications is not comparable.</p>
				<p id="90e762ff-bb66-45a0-b67b-d25aafafcd1e" class="">Given this, it is only natural that the current

				<p id="164071ac-0026-468c-a08f-aad457c6ec49" class="">A prime example is “Plan S,” promoted by Europe. The
