				<p id="91146df9-96db-4be1-9728-26ed5dccbcff" class="">I am an independent researcher working on machine

				<p id="7ead3812-5a21-44a8-906b-eecab47a3764" class="">My goal is to realize research automation and better
					research system. However, these require very long-term technological and intellectual development. So,
					these are not something that can be done by me alone.</p>
				<p id="4646dcea-60b8-4bef-a9c1-0d4959b568ae" class="">I believe we can approach the realization of this goal
					only when more and more people today and in the future commit to this goal. Participation of as many
					people as possible who are interested in this goal, whether in research, engineering, business, design,
					or any other form, no matter what their background, will be an indispensable driving force for this
					goal. I would be happy if readers of this article share the proposed vision and join me in pursuing this
					goal. Let’s do it together!</p>
				<p id="be495efa-5a2f-4d25-a7f0-c46376fe01a0" class="">What I am interested in is not who realizes it but how
					to realize it. Therefore, I would also be happy if those actively researching/working in these fields
					other than me enjoy more support. So, I hope my activities will help the community and society as a
					whole to advance these movements more rapidly.</p>

				<h3 id="f7c63c60-ae12-4e1b-bbf9-dd46cbdba334" class="">Motivation</h3>
				<p id="5f66a487-3217-4a7b-a0f8-eee485c936e0" class="">I have always had a strong admiration and respect for
					research. I think it is cool to do whatever we can to get closer to understanding what we don’t know. I
					also find the culture of sharing knowledge and approaching mysteries with the entire human race,
					transcending time and space, very appealing. I am interested in what is going on in the minds of
					researchers, what lies beyond the pursuit of this activity of research, and to what extent humanity will
					be able to approach the mysteries of the world through research.</p>
				<p id="06af34be-2726-427a-bc29-0ccd3c1682c9" class="">I believe that one of the results of pursuing this
					research activity over the long term is research automation by autonomous artificial intelligence (I am
					sure that many people have similar ideas). From this purely intellectual interest, I would like to aim
					for the realization of an artificial researcher.</p>
				<p id="fba72e49-1fef-42bb-810e-c0f85b9646cc" class="">It is not difficult to imagine the unprecedented
					qualitative/quantitative leap in knowledge production occurs if artificial researchers could be
					realized. I believe that even partial automation could significantly impact society. Actually, many
					results have already begun to emerge. I hope to work with many people to realize this artificial
					researcher.</p>
				<h3 id="d0e2db5a-1bc1-451e-9b8f-cabb9d96826c" class="">Two approaches for research automation</h3>
				<p id="a5ef5932-3b5d-40a6-a376-a34089b1fbe3" class="">I believe there are two approaches to automating
					research. One is to create a general intelligence capable of doing research, and the other is to
					partially automate specific research tasks.</p>
				<p id="42ce1dc9-e555-4569-82af-5acbd8ec4877" class="">I believe that both of these are important and
					complementary. The former is necessary if we were to eventually create artificial researchers. However,
					I recognize that we are still at the stage where basic research with a view to the ultra-long-term
					realization of an artificial researcher is still required.</p>
				<p id="56532d64-0cc2-4a1a-ad08-e7d4db78c9c9" class="">The latter is also very challenging. However,
					researchers have achieved several results. To name a few, DeepMind’s AlphaFold, experimental condition
					search by Bayesian optimization, and automatic extraction of information from papers are well known.
					There have been attempts to automate even the writing of simple research papers. Other ambitious
					attempts are underway, such as having humanoid robots perform experiments.</p>
				<p id="6befc95d-8160-4569-819b-424b4a14f049" class="">I am committed to basic research aimed at
					general-purpose intelligence, partly because of my intellectual interests. At the same time, I believe
					that good guidelines for automation can only emerge from specific practices. So, I think it is essential
					to further promote research on specific research task automation. I have included some brief
					descriptions of research fields related to automation in the appendix. I hope interested parties will
					check it out.</p>

				<h3 id="a5e6681f-0c7f-43d1-9c10-b7a4e20d8a9c" class="">Softwarization of research</h3>
				<p id="4084a892-5d79-47d7-964d-973d9ac87ef6" class="">I believe it is fundamental to represent the research
					process as a pipeline and software in both approaches. For example, in most hypothesis-testing research,
					the research process consists of determining an objective, finding an issue, generating a hypothesis,
					designing experiments, conducting experiments, and analyzing the results. We will represent each of
					these tasks in the flow as a module. Then, we will organize inputs, outputs, and any other restrictions
					for the module. This is like building a domain model of the research process. Based on that, we will
					build a pipeline by incorporating them into the code.</p>

				<h3 id="17d1f101-e6ea-4313-a084-8e064af4abfc" class="">ResearchOps</h3>
				<p id="35fd416c-43d5-46c8-bef1-9ea739f304ba" class="">In machine learning, we build a pipeline representing
					each step in a machine learning project, from data collection to experimentation, deployment,
					maintenance, and operation, and to (semi-)automate each of these steps. The pipeline is divided into a
					Feature module for creating features, a Training module for learning, and so on. We call this automation
					MLOps. This allows for efficient execution of machine learning projects while reducing human error.</p>
				<p id="1c4f4fb1-ad60-4cfd-af84-5369ec610902" class="">What I envision is creating a research version of
					MLOps (ResearchOps). MLOps is filled with know-how on experiment management, common in any empirical
					research. So, I think it is a good model from which we can learn a great deal in promoting the
					construction of research pipelines.</p>
				<p id="aba45437-76b2-40a1-a95b-15e5cac52c7a" class="">I believe that this kind of pipelining discussion is
					particularly advanced in companies. I would like to learn more about this area, and I would be happy if
					the findings become more and more public. If anyone is familiar with this area, I would be glad to learn
					more about it!</p>

				<h3 id="0391097c-61c8-49b2-8d82-3518fedb4e7b" class="">Benefits of research softwarization</h3>
				<p id="b998881d-cb45-48fd-834e-a9ebd47e3030" class="">I believe that the benefits of converting research to
					the software are not limited to increasing production efficiency. One of the advantages is the
					possibility of reducing human error and QRP (Questionable Research Practice) by design without human
					effort by reducing the room for human intervention.</p>
				<p id="3b4d5b39-48c7-4e1c-8b92-caa616ef6745" class="">For example, HARKing, hypothesis generation after
					observing the results of an experiment, is a typical QRP. This is a violation of the order constraint:
					“hypothesis” was entered after the “result” has been entered. Suppose you disallow the researcher to
					enter “hypothesis” after “result” with an error message. Then, you might at least be able to reduce
					unintentional HARKing.</p>
				<p id="3dbc32df-d078-44fd-8a34-6ec4dca25b2c" class="">Furthermore, to express in code means that you can
					benefit from the efficiency knowledge that hackers have built up so far. I believe this is crucial to
					building a more optimal knowledge-producing system.</p>
				<h3 id="f18af75d-d47d-4f24-abd1-9ab35ad4b31a" class="">Why we need pipelining</h3>
				<p id="21269fc9-d9ed-4ab4-8271-254273d3da67" class="">You can easily imagine that when general intelligence
					enough to conduct research is realized, it will conduct research differently than it is today. Given
					this, one might wonder whether it is necessary to naively put current research practices into a pipeline
					(of course, it is necessary for bottom-up automation).</p>
				<p id="8dfa64b4-a5c8-48bd-857d-95e91da19edf" class="">A reason I think pipelining matters is we are far
					behind in the realization of the artificial researcher. Pipelining is an intermediate goal to establish
					guidelines for what inductive bias (constraints to add to the model) we want the artificial intelligence
					to have. Without this, it will be difficult to define what is essential to the act of research and how
					it should be abstracted/implemented. I believe that by automating specific research tasks, we better
					understand what research is like. This makes the roadmap to the realization of artificial researchers
					clearer.</p>

				<p id="2e63e9e8-225c-4ff1-80d9-188c96c3eba7" class="">I am currently engaged in basic research aimed at
					“creating a general intelligence enough to do research” in the long term. However, all of the above are
					essential topics, and the help of many people will be indispensable in promoting this.</p>
				<p id="999a9452-0924-44f5-959c-2caefa2be52c" class="">For example, structuring the research process needs
					discussions in the philosophy of science. The construction of algorithms for automation requires the
					help of machine learning experts. And pipeline construction would not be possible without engineers. The
					knowledge of those familiar with business and law is also valuable. Therefore, I would be happy if as
					many people as possible get interested in this project and work together to make it a reality!</p>
				<p id="086b1662-5027-47a6-8fe8-e352d6a628c9" class="">I am still a newcomer, but many people are already

				<p id="772cc688-e70a-4fd9-90b0-76924b457230" class="">Research is a social activity involving various
					stakeholders. I view the activity of researchers to do research as a system that receives inputs and
					produces knowledge. The knowledge produced is used to produce the next piece of knowledge, so it flows
					recursively into the same system. Therefore, I believe that the optimization of research means improving
					the following quantitatively and qualitatively: 1. inputs to the system, 2. the system itself, and 3.
					output from the system.</p>

				<p id="f88d563e-58aa-4a56-b5dd-d57a83ae2704" class="">Inputs to a knowledge production system are
					categorized into “people,” “money,” and “information (good).” In terms of “money,” we should consider
					how to increase the inflow of funds from more diverse channels. For “people,” you should increase the
					inflow of knowledge-producing and supporting ones while reducing the outflow.</p>
				<p id="5cc82815-5011-4c84-a376-e47e01015cd7" class="">Considering output from the knowledge production
					system is to consider maximizing the utilization of the produced knowledge. Since both topics of inputs
					and output are critical, I would like to write another article on them in the future.</p>
				<h3 id="83c538a2-083b-4408-8d01-1299a2a502d9" class="">Optimization of a multi-layered knowledge production
					system</h3>
				<p id="68c2d519-0059-4281-aea4-57b76e96e03c" class="">I believe that the knowledge production system
					consists of multiple layers, such as individuals, laboratories, research institutions, and research
					ecosystems. My focus on research automation, which I explained above, referred to the automation of the
					research process at the individual level. Also, I was discussing those parts of the process directly
					involved in research. However, to optimize knowledge production, it matters to optimize hierarchies
					other than the individual level and to automate tasks that are not directly involved in research.</p>

				<p id="ec2192cf-ddbe-4eca-8590-bf518a388616" class="">For example, on a laboratory basis, university
					laboratories have laboratory management tasks such as research guidance, funding acquisition, and
					research project management. The issue is to optimize these, especially to make them de-personalized and
					shared knowledge.</p>
				<p id="12d7b13f-8bda-439a-8427-94f4ecec85f5" class="">A university PI (laboratory boss) becomes a PI based
					on their research performance. Nevertheless, once they become a PI, they should provide education,
					research guidance, management, administration, and university office work. It is easy to imagine that
					this can cause a skill mismatch.</p>
				<h3 id="e872401c-fd25-4346-b734-c41ac3a5c3c2" class="">Optimization of the activity of not research</h3>
				<p id="4f0e3feb-ee4e-45f3-870f-529a82fb16a4" class="">Next, let’s talk about automating tasks that are not
					directly related to research. According to a 2018 survey on the breakdown of university faculty activity
					time in Japan, it is reported that university faculty spend about 30% to 50% of their time actually
					devoted to research work. The remaining 50–70% is occupied by tasks such as teaching, various
					administrative procedures, and writing budget applications. Given the goal of optimizing knowledge
					production systems, the impact of automating these non-research tasks will be large.</p>
				<p id="fb22481b-2c9e-41f1-a1f0-857c5f25dc8a" class="">Since this is the automation of tasks that are not
					necessarily unique to research, you can more directly benefit from DX knowledge in other industries. In
					this sense, if as many people on the business side who have this knowledge could cooperate with us, we
					may be able to make great progress in improving research efficiency.</p>
				<p id="71790ce4-59ea-438c-b51d-015e56ba22ab" class="">Results of a survey by Rahenau Instituut on the
					research time of Dutch researchers also indicate that researchers devote much of their time to
					activities outside of research.</p>

				<p id="8fa33ea8-c8d6-4c43-933d-339fc4e49f3f" class="">As I mentioned above, I believe it will be positive
					for the entire research ecosystem in the long run if the research field flourishes outside of the
					current research ecosystem. This is one of the reasons I am doing independent research. So I hope that
					more researchers will become independent or do research in a new style. If you are interested in being
					an independent researcher or want to try various research styles, I would be happy to help you. Please
					contact me by all means!</p>
				<p id="e50bb8d5-f228-4ea2-ae82-99b6c4135a9c" class="">My specialty is machine learning, so I have been able
					to do my research individually with little hindrance. Also, I have been blessed with wonderful friends
					giving me a job. So my methods may not be very reproducible. However, I may be able to share what I know
					in my own way, or I may be able to introduce you to a job if the conditions are right for you. Many
					people have been doing research on their own for a long time. Even if I can’t do something directly, I
					may be able to introduce information about how they are living their lives.</p>
				<p id="abdeeb48-b06f-4527-84ef-40faa4ccf6e5" class="">I think some people want to do your research yourself.
					Some might have had a hard time in the current lab. Others may be temporarily freelancing until they get
					their next position. If any of those people are interested, feel free to contact me!</p>
				<h3 id="c24e822c-c32f-4390-aa66-f71a973cc884" class="">I’m looking for people to try different research
					methods with!</h3>
				<p id="2552152b-73b2-43d4-ba8e-45f0a073f3a3" class="">As I have written in other articles, I would like to
					manage the entire research process on GitHub. Besides that, there are many other things I would like to
					do. For example, I would like to conduct research with a full-fledged project manager, or create a DAO
					to conduct research. I would like to explore various research styles by running a hypothesis testing
					cycle.</p>
				<p id="23dca50a-9957-4216-b79b-3f38c6d5603d" class="">I’m going to do these even on my own. But I think it
					is more fun to work together so that we can come up with new ideas and try out ideas that I cannot do
					alone. So I am also looking for researchers interested in trying out new research methods together! I
					believe the next generation of research will emerge from this kind of bottom-up trial-and-error process.
					Let’s all try different ways of doing research!</p>
				<p id="e0e872cb-475f-4114-b965-a526dc3d689e" class="">Some people are interested in this kind of thing but
					cannot do it due to restrictions in their position or research field. In such cases, I would be happy to
					just hear your ideas. As a person free to do various things at my discretion, I would like to try out
					the ideas for those people!</p>

				<p id="107fd7b1-cccc-4476-94d8-c58dc672dd3d" class="">I have written this article hoping that as many people
					as possible will be interested in research automation and better research system. I would be happy if
					some of you join me to pursue these goals.</p>
				<p id="f7807eef-3294-4ccb-a0b9-628f00b18564" class="">I have already expanded the scope of this article
					considerably. Before I end this article, let me expand it just a little bit more.</p>
				<h3 id="f8827ff5-9f03-4d01-8764-246447547664" class="">My ultimate goals</h3>
				<p id="264448a9-d4e5-4590-9843-275bd2854705" class="">I’m interested in how much of the unknown of this
					world can be made known. In other words, I am interested in and aim for a world in which we can make as
					much of this world’s unknowns known as quickly as possible.</p>
				<p id="059e1051-7205-4fd0-a2b8-fc2e73f27b4f" class="">To that end, I believe it is necessary to 1. improve
					knowledge production, 2. update the human ability to comprehend, and 3. aim for the perpetuation of
					humans by transplanting them into machines. 1 is the part I have described so far. I intend to
					contribute to the realization of the above world by committing myself to this.</p>
				<p id="d03a0c5f-9053-4bca-8993-b4bd57fd7dbb" class="">The autonomous artificial researcher I want to aim for
					in 1 is the kind of being that will overcome humanity. Thus, I hope that 2 and 3 will progress so that
					even after their emergence, humans can still enjoy understanding knowledge. So, I wholeheartedly support
					anyone working on 2 or 3! If there’s anything I can do for you, please feel free to contact me anytime!

					for experimental conditions, deep neural networks to predict protein structure, parameter estimation for
					theoretical models, etc. I have the impression that DeepMind, famous for AlphaGo, is trying to advance
					this on a large scale. Like DeepMind, I believe that attention is being paid to how machine learning can
					be used for scientific discovery.</p>

					It is an attempt to automate mathematical proofs by computer. In particular, methods that combine
					conventional automatic proofs of theorems with machine learning have emerged in recent years. Czech
