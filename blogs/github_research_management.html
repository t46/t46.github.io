				<p id="50fcc185-3fb4-4dc5-9109-f79963ce9315" class="">I am an independent researcher in machine learning. In
					this article, I will provide the idea of managing research on GitHub. I welcome your comments and
					suggestions on this thought.</p>

				<h3 id="16e75c09-e0b2-4c33-bbb7-fd39abd40f64" class="">Introduction</h3>
				<p id="e1959221-de85-4cc6-869a-0f353e05e022" class="">Many researchers are willing to share their knowledge
					and collaborate with other researchers. I believe that by making it easier for researchers to share
					knowledge and contribute to the others’ research, we can accelerate knowledge production.</p>
				<p id="3efa72ed-ee10-49b8-b5a4-f96903705d9e" class="">One idea to make this possible is to manage research
					on GitHub. I know that experimental code is published on GitHub in some research community. On the other
					hand, I propose to manage all intermediate outputs of the research process on GitHub, from the
					determination of the research topic to the post-publication paper. Literally, all intermediate products,
					including information about how researchers found the literature, what they thought, what initial
					experiments they did, etc.</p>
				<p id="573b77bf-3d76-4569-a08d-0634c18e9587" class="">I believe there are several advantages to managing
					your research on GitHub. I will explain them one by one below.</p>
				<hr id="1174318b-718a-489a-a25a-936326232cf9" />
				<h3 id="c569b104-c275-423e-bebe-6e1c1482e627" class="">1. GitHub clarifies contributors</h3>
				<p id="4b38abea-4bed-4e8e-acc4-1b77235b9afa" class="">The first advantage is that managing research on
					GitHub clarifies who contributed and how. Suppose that all discussions and revisions of the manuscript
					are on GitHub. Then, the commit history can be traced to show who contributed to what part of the
					research process at a glance. Even if the authors’ names are not listed in the paper, the history on
					GitHub makes it clear to everyone the appropriate allocation of credit for the research.</p>
				<p id="897c9c87-8290-4406-ad9a-6059d21418f6" class="">This might, for example, eliminate the gift-authorship
					problems. Or it may solve the problem of how to order author names in a collaborative research project.
					It may also address the plagiarism issue. This is because these are the problems that one’s contribution
					is not recognized in the publication. I believe visualizing the contributions in the research process
					alleviates these problems.</p>
				<h3 id="4d9d8dc7-9a75-41ca-b5b0-77614c9058f3" class="">2. GitHub allows for finer contributions</h3>
				<p id="c1e14ea5-a883-461c-b81b-27949d38d778" class="">The second advantage is that on a more granular basis
					you can publish research results and contribute to research. For example, someone good at statistical
					analysis may be able to commit only to the statistical analysis part. Or someone good at writing may
					contribute to the paper writing. Also, citing a commit hash might make it possible to refer to specific
					ideas, results of experiments, problem formulation, etc. I believe this would allow researchers to
					utilize multiple talents more effectively in their research.</p>
				<h3 id="c4d6b019-bec0-45a9-8c2d-725ddb90f74a" class="">3. GitHub improves reproducibility</h3>
				<p id="776925cb-2ebc-488c-b656-b12beea1f781" class="">The third advantage is that it may lead to better
					reproducibility of research. Here, I will talk about machine learning, my field of expertise. As
					mentioned above, machine learning researchers publish their code on GitHub. However, information about
					the research process, such as “when it didn’t work” and “what hyperparameters were important,” is lost
					in the final repositories.</p>
				<p id="00256b2b-c22b-467c-b1df-caaff8157fe1" class="">If you use the same settings as in the repository,
					there is no problem. However, if you change the code for your experiments, it sometimes does not work
					well. This means you should repeat the same process of searching for conditions the original proposer
					probably went through. In addition, many heuristics are not described or emphasized in the paper. I
					suspect this is due to the current pressure in the machine learning community to publish positive
					results to get into good international conferences. Publishing all intermediate thoughts and outputs of
					the research process would allow researchers to avoid making the same mistake twice.</p>
				<p id="64818660-b643-47e9-9917-80419fed6a4a" class="">In addition, logging research process may contribute
					to reducing questionable research practices. For example, it might be possible to reduce the number of
					HarKing by making it possible to compare the time stamp when the hypothesis was determined with the time
					stamp when the experimental results were obtained. I believe that these attempt could lead to more
					reproducible and transparent research practices.</p>

				<h3 id="480fdcc1-467c-4f4a-a65f-18e01953200e" class="">4. GitHub enables post-review</h3>
				<p id="132baf66-21e6-40b3-951d-f8449359a208" class="">The fourth advantage is that it may address the review
					crisis, which is also a problem in machine learning research. In machine learning research, there are
					not enough reviewers for the increasing number of researchers and papers. Because of an insufficient
					number of reviewers, non-experts often review. This results in the decline and variation in the quality
					of reviews.</p>
				<p id="a2bdb233-cab7-45d3-ad6f-2b065f2fb724" class="">To solve this problem, I believe it matters to adopt
					post-review. Post-review is an attempt to ensure the validity of papers by evaluating the results after
					publication. It enables research paper evaluation by many people over a long period.</p>
				<p id="06c063c3-8d1a-49da-895c-4fd97f4cf10a" class="">I believe that managing the research on GitHub would
					help to achieve this post-review. You first place the LaTex file or markdown file of published paper on
					GitHub. Then, you accept corrections and comments on the file by pull request. This will allow more
					people to participate in the evaluation of the published paper at any time and in any form they wish.
				</p>
				<h3 id="165149da-4efb-42bf-a88e-f2c540b9e007" class="">5. GitHub embraces diversity</h3>
				<p id="fa1558e3-2502-4997-9f09-61cdc33ac4d2" class="">The fifth advantage is that more diverse people can
					participate in a single research project. Open collaboration does not care who a person is, what
					institution they belong, or what their background is. It does not matter what race, social class, or
					educational background they have. I believe that research collaboration through GitHub will contribute
					to solving the diversity problem that many research communities are facing today.</p>

				<p id="1389b541-f240-4c07-9d0c-65a62e62cbca" class="">Diversity is one of the important topics in top AI
					conferences (from <a href="https://nips.cc/Conferences/2019/DiversityInclusion">NeurIPS 2021</a>)</p>
				<h3 id="e3eaa8ea-11ef-4d24-aa5b-e6f8799ce2ad" class="">6. GitHub protects research ideas</h3>
				<p id="8f5fa99e-1f3e-42a9-b43c-cc554ce94162" class="">The sixth advantage is that more people may be able to
					publish unpublished content without fear of plagiarism. As mentioned above, a research log on GitHub
					shows who was thinking of what ideas and when. Therefore, even if a similar research idea appears later,
					you can track who states it first by checking the commit history. Therefore, more people are willing to
					share knowledge with others without fear of having their idea stolen by someone else. These are
					advantages I think research management on GitHub brings about.</p>

				<h3 id="007ac07b-b752-4816-b6a2-ead96822b516" class="">Conclusion</h3>
				<p id="ed98d3d2-8a76-4d9b-a2f2-9a48cf290abb" class="">I would like to put as much of my future research as
					possible on the above framework. However, I am not very good at engineering, so I have yet to implement
					a meaningful prototype. So, if you share the above ideas and have engineering skills, I would like you
					to create more and more prototypes.</p>
				<p id="b2cba494-4b16-4c2c-a776-de195e428ec1" class="">I believe that if engineers who are much better than I
					am could promote this kind of movement, it will accelerate research development. I would be happy to
					help these talents anytime in any way. I am also looking for people to work with me in these efforts, so
					if you are interested, please contact me!</p>
